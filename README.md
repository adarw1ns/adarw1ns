<h3>Tennis Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fell in love with tennis 18 years ago, and will dedicate the rest of my life to this beautiful sport.
<li>13 years ago I also started coaching tennis part-time, eventually going full-time at several clubs/programs in NJ.
<li>Helped successfully open a 9-court indoor tennis club in Edgewater NJ.
<li>Leading High Performance clinics for elite junior players(6 courts, 24 students, 5 coaches).
<li>10,000+ hours teaching tennis at all levels and ages

Combining my two passions, I am starting my own business again; <i><b>North Star Tennis Academy</b></i>.</br>
My goal is to use my skills as a developer/designer to build tools that will help my students becoming better players and enjoy this sport for longer. As well making this sport more accessible to low income communities and aspiring junior players.
